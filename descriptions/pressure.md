## Objective (Idle)
**Idle Game:** No objective. The player earns 1 token per second (1tps) for having the game window open with their wallet connected. The job could be called something like 'Sleuce Valve Tech'. Earnings of 1tps calculated during gameplay, sent in 1 transaction upon 'clock-out'.

## Objective Alternative (Interactive)

Your task is to maintain the pressure gauges within the green zone for as long as possible. The longer you keep them there, the more tokens you earn.

## Gameplay

### Setup

When players enter the minigame, they are presented with a control panel displaying three vertical pressure gauges side by side. Each gauge has a green zone in the middle, a yellow zone above, and a critical red zone below.

### Starting Tokens

Players start with 0 tokens in their associated token account for this minigame.

### Game Mechanics

- **Gauge 1:** This gauge falls at a medium rate.
- **Gauge 2:** This gauge falls at a quicker rate.
- **Gauge 3:** This gauge steadily rises.

### Player Interaction

To keep the gauges within the green zone, players must interact with knobs located below each gauge. Clicking a knob will turn it, affecting the corresponding gauge's pressure. Turning a knob clockwise will increase pressure, while turning it counterclockwise will decrease pressure. Players need to find the right balance for each gauge.

### Earning Tokens

Players earn tokens based on the duration all three gauges remain within the green zone simultaneously. For every second that all gauges are in the green, they earn 1 token, which is automatically deposited into their associated token account.

### Token Deduction

If any of the three gauges enters the yellow zone, no tokens are earned for that second. If any gauge enters the critical red zone, 1 token is deducted from the player's associated token account for that second.

### Clocking Out

Players can "clock out" at any moment by pressing a button. When they do so, the tokens they've earned during their play session are transferred from their associated token account to their main account, making them available for in-game purchases and upgrades.

### Difficulty Scaling

The game's difficulty increases gradually by increasing the rate at which the gauges move. This ensures that players must stay focused and adapt to changing conditions to maximize their token earnings.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balancing act:** Pay close attention to all three gauges simultaneously, and don't let any of them stray too far from the green zone.

- **Timing is crucial:** Click the knobs strategically to make small adjustments to the gauges. Quick reflexes and precision are key to success.

- **Risk and reward:** Players can decide when to "clock out" based on their confidence in maintaining the gauges. Clocking out too early means fewer tokens, but staying too long risks losing tokens due to gauge fluctuations.
